# Asos.QA.RecruitmentTest

Firstly we *really* appreciate you taking the time to complete this test, as we understand how valuable you time is! 

At ASOS we love automation, in order to help us ensure that we're the right fit for you we ask you to complete a short exercise in the language of your choice as well as answer some questions around the analytical side of QA that is equally important!

This exercise consists of 2 parts:

- Automation Exercise
- Written Test

As part of this recruitment test we would ask you to complete the Automation Exercise and the Written Test and upload the files to a google drive folder/dropbox and share the link with us. 

Please include your name and the role you applied for as part of the filename.

## Automation Exercise ##

This exercise is about us seeing your technical skills when it comes to dealing with UI automation. 

ASOS have a website (we hope you knew that already!?) at http://www.asos.com and there are a whole host of features on the website that help provide a unique and engaging customer eexperience. 

One feature that is used a lot is the Search functionality, this exercise is about implementing some step definiteions for a given scenario:

'''
Feature: Search for products
As a customer
I want to be able to find products based on a search term
So that I can see relevant products that I am interested in

Scenario: Search for products
Given I am on the asos homepage
When I search for "Jeans"
Then I am shown "Jeans" in the search results

'''

##Technical Deets##
You can use any language, any framework you want! So long as it meets the requirements of providing a UI Automated Test that meets the Scenario above.

Please also create a readme providing details on the framework chosen and why, how it can be set up etc. so that we can view the solution painlessly! :) Also so we can get an idea on how you think and why you chose certain toolsets/language etc!
